\description{
The following procedure constructs the so-called repartition
estimates of the breaks obtained by the sequential method (see Bai
(1995), Estimating Breaks one at a time, Econometric Theory, 13,
315-352. It alows estimates that have the same asymptotic
distribution as those obtained by global minimization. Otherwise, the
output from the procedure "estim" below do not deliver asymptotically
correct confidence intervals for the break dates.
