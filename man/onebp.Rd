\description{
Function computes the optimal one break partition in partial structural
change model by searching over all possible breaks given x regressors
have unchanged coefficients. Iteration to convergence is used to deal with
2 sets of estimates needed to obtain: full-sample coefficients and regime-specific
coefficients
